- 👋 Hi, I’m @KyleKaminky
- 👀 I’m interested in creating aesthetically pleasing visualizations and animations that inspire others to learn, create, and admire
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a children's puzzle challenge and designing a full-stack application that tracks when I am in a meeting for my wife and kids to look at
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on visualizations/animations, RF stuff, software-defined radio and web development projects
